# Presentation article 
## The article
Atteveldt, Wouter van, and Tai-Quan Peng. ‘When Communication Meets Computation: Opportunities, Challenges, and Pitfalls in Computational Communication Science’. *Communication Methods and Measures* 12, no. 2–3 (3 April 2018): 81–92. https://doi.org/10.1080/19312458.2018.1458084
## Plan
- Monday: online - discuss article understanding 
- Tuesday: meet after class (15:30) - discuss tasks, points
- Wednesday: maybe trial run of th epresentation and discuss other articles

## What still needs to be done? 
- [ ] Which part of the presentation is being presented by who?
- [ ] Who makes the slides
- [ ] Summarise article - name article, and context of article
- [ ] Think of questions 
- [ ] Do we agree/disagree, what did we think/personal reflection, and how are we going ti=o intergrate this in our presentation?
- [ ] Explain unfamiliar concepts 

### Presentation structure (idea)
1) Introduce paper (provenance) (0,5 min)
2) Research question and goal/aim (0,5 min)
3) Important concepts (+ explanations) (2 min)
4) Ties broader course themes, (2 min)
5) Comparison reading (2  min)
6) Personal reflections/applications (2 min)

### Requirements presentation: 
- A brief overview of the week’s topic and the relevance of the assigned readings;
- Concise summaries of each reading, highlighting the main arguments and key points (i.e., identification of the central thesis or research question in each reading);
- A discussion of the significant contributions of each reading to the broader field of study (e.g., an explanation of how the readings advance or challenge existing knowledge);
- An in-depth critique of the key arguments presented in the readings. This includes the identification of strengths, weaknesses, and any potential biases in the readings, a consideration of the methodologies used and their appropriateness for the research questions;
- A comparison of the readings with each other, highlighting similarities, differences, and any contrasting perspectives (e.g., a discussion of how the readings interact with or complement one another);
- A connection of the readings to broader themes or ongoing debates in the field;
- A reflection on the implications of the readings for future research or practical applications, personal or group insights gained from the readings and how they have informed your understanding of the topic and of your ongoing project;
- Thought-provoking questions for class discussion, designed to stimulate further analysis and debate. Questions should encourage critical thinking and connect the readings to broader course themes;
- Use of visual aids (e.g., slides, diagrams) to enhance clarity and engagement but ensure that visuals support and do not overwhelm the presentation content.
