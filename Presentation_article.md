# Presentation article 
## The article
Atteveldt, Wouter van, and Tai-Quan Peng. ‘When Communication Meets Computation: Opportunities, Challenges, and Pitfalls in Computational Communication Science’. *Communication Methods and Measures* 12, no. 2–3 (3 April 2018): 81–92. https://doi.org/10.1080/19312458.2018.1458084
## Plan
- Monday: online - discuss article understanding 
- Tuesday: meet after class (15:30) - discuss tasks, points
- Wednesday: maybe trial run of th epresentation and discuss other articles

## What still needs to be done? 
- [ ] Which part of the presentation is being presented by who?
- [ ] Who makes the slides
- [ ] Summarise article - name article, and context of article
- [ ] Think of questions 
- [ ] Do we agree/disagree, what did we think/personal reflection, and how are we going ti=o intergrate this in our presentation?
- [ ] Explain unfamiliar concepts 

### Discussion articles (suggested aid)
Questions/topics to keep in mind while reading: 
- What is the research/question of the article (- how is it answered)
- What is the aim/goal of the article (who is the audience)
- What tools are mentioned within the article (if applicable)
- What are important points/concepts?
- What personal connotations do I have when reading the article?
- What questions do I have while reading the article?
- What do I find interesting in the article?

Notes: 
In your discussion and presentation pay special attention to both the opportunities and the limitations of the data and methods discussed/used in the two articles. 

### Presentation structure (suggested)
1) Introduce paper (provenance) (0,5 min)
2) Research question and goal/aim (0,5 min)
3) Important concepts (+ explanations) (2 min)
4) Ties broader course themes, (2 min)
5) Comparison reading (2  min)
6) Personal reflections/applications (2 min)

### Requirements presentation: 
- A brief overview of the week’s topic and the relevance of the assigned readings;
    - Book Chapter 4: Metadata and categorization, data description
    - Overall theme: Digital methods and data management
    - Book chapter 5: Database design, relational databases
    - Our article: Development of computational methods in communication science. Analyzing digitally available data, the limitations and how to approach big data.       Potential advantages. 
    - Second article: database design of systematically categorizing (in a desriptive way) two different (cultural heritage) archives and linking them allowing           better access the data they contain. Using visualization tools and methods for the enrichment of metadata
    
- Concise summaries of each reading, highlighting the main arguments and key points (i.e., identification of the central thesis or research question in each reading);
    - Our article:
        - Research question: To discuss the validity of using big data in communication science, showcased through specific example of different new methods
        - Main argument: New computational methods and old methods are complimentary, enhance the existing tools. However, traditional methods are not out of date
        - Proposes both opportunities and challenges in using computational methods in science
        - These developments are fueled by at least 3 developments
            - A flux of digitally available data
            - Improved tools to analyze this data
            - The emergence of powerul and cheap processing power
        - Need for:
          - transparant culture of sharing, making data and documenting tools,
          - encourage interdiscplinary collaborations,
          - investment to encourage the use of computational tools
          - promotion of the education required to use these tools
          - Train coder bias -> train coders to use codebooks to annotate -> leads to systematic categorization, which results in the loss of insight

  Bigger course theme:
  - The importance of **documentation**

    - Second article:
        - Research question: To study wether it is possible to extend and enrich the annotation of legacy image collections, with concepts and methods from visual             analytics
        - Main argument: to showcase the datamanagement and document the process of the use of visual analytics and its limitations concerning the annotations of             legacy image collections
        - Use of expert annotated data, quality of labeling is important (ties into chapter 4: meta data:))
        - Working with large collections of cultural material is not always a linear process,
        - influence of the 'fickle' but 'usefull' human hand and interpretation 
     
- A discussion of the significant contributions of each reading to the broader field of study (e.g., an explanation of how the readings advance or challenge existing knowledge);
  - Our article (2018)
      - Questions and issues of transparancy of big data are valid
      - Poses valid questions of anonimity and ethical problems of online data
      - Real time data can be positive, causal relationships are more easily found (rather than corralative relationships) - due to tracking in real time
    
- An in-depth critique of the key arguments presented in the readings. This includes the identification of strengths, weaknesses, and any potential biases in the readings, a consideration of the methodologies used and their appropriateness for the research questions;
  - Our article (2018)
      - Outdated,
          - Ethical questions are outlined 
          - Some concerns are not answered yet : access to digital social media message
          - Rapid development of social media and techology seems more stagnant and has become more normative
      - Opportunity: self-report, behavioral measurement, poses several limitations, how valid is (online) big data?
      - Bias of digtally available data extends beyond issues of self-report, which are not detailed within the article (masks, small to large n, missing context)
      - To what extend does online behavior mimic real social behavior?
      - Oversampling vs undersampling (who is active, who isnt)
   
    - Second article
      - Accesibilty, but the use of language is highly professional/specialized and not easily accessed or understood (elite)

- A comparison of the readings with each other, highlighting similarities, differences, and any contrasting perspectives (e.g., a discussion of how the readings interact with or complement one another);
- Similarities
     - The need and importance of interdisciplanary approaches and collaborations
     - The need to share and exchange tools and knowledge (in order for processes to be replicated)
     - The need for comprehensive documentation
     - The making selecions and deselctions, through that the influence of human interpretation
     - The treatment of meta data

 - Differences
     - Overview of different literatures, second article is a documentation of an individual study
     - Our article: concerns different disciplines, 2nd article: concerns specialists

- A connection of the readings to broader themes or ongoing debates in the field;
    - Accesibilty
    - openness/transparancy of documentation is important, but for who is this accesible?
    - 'human error' or influence 

- A reflection on the implications of the readings for future research or practical applications, personal or group insights gained from the readings and how they have informed your understanding of the topic and of your ongoing project;
  - Documentation should not use specialised language if there is a want for transparancy (espeically in an interdisciplanary group)
  - Human influence can be a good thing, can enrich data categorization
  - Need to be critical of data, definitions, choices made etc.

- Thought-provoking questions for class discussion, designed to stimulate further analysis and debate. Questions should encourage critical thinking and connect the readings to broader course themes;
  - Ethical: Researchers can be scared of ethical laws, as they might block their right to research. How can we deal with sensitivity of data coming from social media platforms. Is that data still usable?
  - Consent: should you be allowed to use the data if the users thoughtlessly agreed and gave consent, is it still informed consent? 

- Use of visual aids (e.g., slides, diagrams) to enhance clarity and engagement but ensure that visuals support and do not overwhelm the presentation content.
